I graduated from the Department of Mathematics, Anhui University, China. During the school I almost did not learn anything. IÂ began to learn the relevant knowledge and skills after graduation.

I now work in embedded DTV system, the main work is to migrate of traditional television systems to Android.In my free time, I like to write some small tools to make work more enjoyable. Usually I write some games for my son, and he was very happy to participate in the game of designs, these things are very interesting.

Currently I&#8217;m very interested in cross-platform development, and I hope one code can run on different platforms, such as Android / IOS / HTML5 / Desktop &#8230;, I chose Java as a development language, I hope I can write some tools and make program easyly.
